###Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Stretch Goals
Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.
Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
“As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

The basic story of your application
The core features of your MVP
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
Challenges you expect to face
How you are meeting the requirements of the project
Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.

MVP ASAP
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need
Instructor Guidance
You should strive to solve problems independently, but you also shouldn't waste your time stuck on a problem. A good guideline for a small bug is the rule of 10s:

10 minutes debugging the code
10 minutes using Google and StackOverflow to try to find an answer
10 minutes asking your fellow students for help
Asking an instructor
If you seek out instructor guidance on your design from the start, they might help steer you into design and architectural decisions that will help you down the road. That will also give the instructors context for what your app is supposed to do, so you won't need to explain everything to them when asking for help debugging.

Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:

Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.
Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable.
